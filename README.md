# diy-stable-diffusion

## `nbs`: Notebooks
nbs directory is a bunch of notebooks reproducing the steps in the course.fast.ai lesson notebooks,
with very messy tinkering steps to get a feel for libraries and techniques. 

## `diy_stable_diffusion` the library
From the notebooks, the homegrown 'library' is written because individual cells I wrote get exported into a module
which eventually implements the whole 'stable diffusion from scratch' idea.
